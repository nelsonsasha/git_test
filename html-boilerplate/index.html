        <h3>HISTORY, PURPOSE AND USAGE</h3>

        <!-- Below we have used two types of HTML Tags <strong> & <em> -->

        <p><strong>ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying 
        out print, graphic or web designs.</strong> The passage is attributed to an unknown
        typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of 
        Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. 
        It usually begins with:</p>

        <p><em>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
        incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.‚Äù</em></p>

        <p><strong> purpose of <em>lorem ipsum</em> is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence,
         paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn't distract from the layout.</strong> A practice not without
         controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the
         focus is meant to be on design, not content.</p>

         <p><strong><em>passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used
         it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled
         the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites,
         and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative
